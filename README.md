GOALS:
Create a web application that allows users to...

1. track the the many variables that could potentially affect their fitness-related goals (i.e. strength gains and/or body-composition improvements) and to easily visualize progress in relation to one or many of those variables in order to better understand what affects their progress.   

2. build a workout planner in which they are able to create workout routines (list of exercises with sets, rep-ranges and weight).

3. log workout sessions in the workout planner.
